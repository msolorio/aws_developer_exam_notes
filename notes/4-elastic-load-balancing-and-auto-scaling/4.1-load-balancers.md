# S3

Simple Storage Service
- access S3 using the URL
- public service available directly via the internet
- sits outside VPC

---

## IAM Roles

- identity to which you can assign a policy
- instances can assume roles giving them permissions

- Allows us to not have to store access keys on instance

---

### Exercise

- From S3 console
  - Create a bucket
    - name of bucket should be globally unique
    - choose region
      - S3 bucket gets stored in a single region

- Launch EC2 instance
  - give SSH

- SSH into instance

list s3 buckets in aws account
- `aws s3 ls`
- notice we don't have access

#### Connect EC2 instance to S3 with access keys (not best practice)

Add access key credentials to EC2 instance
- `aws configure`

- Generate new access key
  - In IAM console > Users > your user > Security credentials > create access key

- paste in access key ID
- paste in secret access key

- `aws s3 ls`

find credentials on EC2 instance
- `cat .aws/credentials`
- **not secure, not best practice**

#### Connect EC2 to S3 with IAM Roles Instead

- SSH'ed into EC2 instance
- delete credentials file

In IAM console
- create role
  - add policy - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  - give role a name   
- After creation can view
  - trust relationship - trusted entities that can assume the role
  - policy

In EC2 console
  - instance security > modify IAM role
  - Attach role to instance

- `aws s3 ls`
- we can now see buckets

## Elastic Load Balancing Concepts

Load Balancer
- load balancer attached to a region
  - cannot load balance across regions
  - load balance across AZs
- Used commonly for
  - static web applications
  - web apps where all instances are accessing same database

- Uses single endpoint to connect to load balancer
- load balancer then chooses a target to direct traffic to

- Health Checks used to determine if instance is online
  - load balancer will not route traffic to it

### Types of Load Balancers Overview

#### Classic Load Balancer
- depricated / not recommended
- performs route at
  - layer 4 - transport layer - TCP, SSL
  - Layer 7 - Applicaiton layer - HTTP, HTTPS

#### Application Load Balancer
- operates at the request level
- routes based on content of the request
  - layer 7 - application layer
- supports
  - path-based routing
  - host-based routing
  - query string parameter-based routing
  - source IP address-based routing
- supports as targets
  - IP addresses
  - lambda functions
  - containers

---

#### Network Load Balancer
- Operates at the connection level (connects to the internet)
- Routes connections based on IP protocol data
  - IP addresses (source / destination)
  - operates at layer 4 - transport layer
- cannot route traffic based on HTTP header info
- *ultra high performance*
- *low latency*
- TLS offloading - can handle the SSL encryption
- Supports UDP and static IPs as targets

- Internet Facing
- Sits behind the Internet Gateway
- can be assigned a static elastic IP
- Routes traffic to the private IPs of the instances

---

### Exercise - Set Up Network Load Balancer

- Create S3 bucket
- upload to bucket - provided files
  - index.txt
  - names.csv

- Launch 2 EC2 instances
- give role to full access to S3
- Give it user data (provided)
  - install apache server
  - start server
  - copy names.csv file (update path to our s3)
  - copy index.txt file (update path to our s3)
  - writes random name to index.html file
  - (allows us to distinguish between instances when visiting)

  - security group
    - SSH and HTTP

- Create Network Load Balancer
  - specify TCP as protocol
  - select AZs
    - select at least 2
  - create a target group
  - Health Checks
    - healthy threshhold - 2
    - interval - 10 seconds
  - add instances to target group

From load balancer console
  - can set different ports to listen on
    - send them to different Target Groups
  
In Target Groups
  - explore tabs

In load balancer console
  - copy DNS name of load balancer
  - paste in private / incognito window
  - different user agents (browser sessions) are assigned to different instances

Clean Up
- Delete
  - load balancer
  - target groups
  - EC2 instances
