# Auto Scaling

## EC2 Auto Scaling Overview

- Automatically launch and terminate instances

- Maintain target number of instances
  - If instance fails its health check
    - launch another instance to replace it

- Using Metrics
  - cloudwatch can monitor
    - CPU
    - number of connections
    - disk IO
  - when metric is hit can trigger launching or terminating instances

- Can be used in combination with a load balancer

- An **Auto Scaling Group** is created from a **Launch Configuration / Template**
- **Launch Configuration / Template** specifies what type of instances the Auto Scaling Group will automatically create

---

## Exercise - Set Up Auto Scaling with a Load Balancer

From EC2 management console
- Create launch configuration for auto scaling group
  - give IAM role for S3 full access
  - Paste user data that gives instance a name
  - web access security group - SSH, HTTP

- create auto scaling group
  - give name
  - choose launch configuration
  - group size - 2
  - choose 2 subnets
  - configure scaling policies
    - between 2 and 4 instances
    - based on CPU - 70 (70%)

- After Auto Scaling Group creation explore tabs
  - activity history
  - updating scaling policies
  - can schedule a scaling event

- Create Application Load Balancer
  - specify subnets based on where instances were launched
    - or all subnets
  - Add target group TG1
  - don't need to register targets
  - want to connect to auto scaling group

- in autoscaling group
  - select target group - TG1
    - this will connect it to load balancer
  - Health Check Type - EC2

  - can check status of instances attached to auto scaling group

- get dns name from load balancer
  - can cycle between instances

---

## Auto Scaling Group - Scaling Policies

- Add a scaling policy
  - step scaling policy
    - name Maintain load
    - create an alarm
      - execute policy when CPU utilization is 70% or greater for 5 minutes
      - add 1 instance
  - remove target tracking scaling policy

- Generate load
  - on each instance
    - ssh into an instance
    - install stress utility
      - `sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y`
      - `sudo yum install stress -y`

    - run stress command
      - `stress -c 8`

- In auto scaling groups console > monitoring
  - observe cpu usage
  - when both instances hit above threshold watch for new instance coming online
- go to activity history
  - view logged activity

- terminate an instance
  - watch another one come online to replace it

Clean Up
- Delete 
  - Auto Scaling Group
  - launch configuration
  - load balancer
  - target group
  - EC2 instances

## Launch Configuration and Launch Templates

### Launch configuration
- Attached to an Auto Scaling Group
- Specifies what kind of instance auto scaling group launches

- Can specify anything you would when creating an EC2 instance
- AMI
- instance type
- security group
- IAM roles
- other settings...

- Launch configurations cannot be modified after creation
- Can instead copy and modify copy

---

### Launch Templates

- similar options to launch configurations
- under advanced details can configure many more config options

- Can create a Launch Template from an existing instance
  - actions > create template from instance

- Can configure **fleet composition**
  - mix spot instances with on-demand instances

---

## Auto Scaling Health Checks

- Auto Scaling uses the EC2 instance **status checks**
  - if instance has instance state other than *running* it will terminate the instance and replace it

- System status check
- Instance status checks

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Health Checks

- Elastic Load Balancer performs its own **ELB health checks** as well as performs the **EC2 status checks**
  - if instance does not pass both checks it will terminate and replace it
  - Auto Scaling Group regularly pings ELB to know which instances available

- Recommended to use **ELB Health Checks** option with your Auto Scaling Group
  - otherwise ELB may take an instance offline if unhealthy and Auto Scaling will not know that it has been taken offline

---

## Auto Scaling Termination Policies

- ASG needs to terminate an instance in response to an event
- ASG realizes you don't need the capacity anymore

- When creating/editing an ASG
  - can set a termination policy

- Defult Termination Policy
  - Determining Which instance to terminate
    - AZ with most instances
    - try to balance the amount of on-demand or spot instances to match your desired amount
    - terminate the instance that uses the oldest launch template or configuration
    - remove the instance closes to the next billing hour

- When creating/editing an ASG
  - instance protection - determine which instances to not terminate
  - Supended Processes
    - skip certain auto scaling processes, ie. Termination, ReplaceUnhealthy

---

## Cross-Zone Load Balancing

- Allows your ELB to distribute traffic across AZs based on how many instances in each AZ.
- Allows for distributing equal amount of load to each instance

[see slide diagram]

Application Load Balancer
- enabled by default

Network Load Balancer
- disabled by default

---

### Exercise - Set Up Auto Scaling Group

- Create Launch Configuration
  - S3 full access IAM role
  - paste in user data
    - shows random name for each instance
  - web access security group

- Create Auto Scaling Group
   - 3 instances
   - split across 2 AZs

Clean Up
- Keep set up in place for next 2 labs

---

## Exercise - Network Load Balancer Cross-Zone

- Create Network Load Balancer
  - internet facing
  - add in AZs where instances live
  - Create new Target Group - TG1
    - Healthy threshold - 2
    - Register all targets

- Currently Cross Zone Load Balancing is disabled

- Visit the DNS name of the load balancer
- Try visiting in multiple private browsing windows

- Enable cross zone load balancing

- Visit again in private browsing windows
