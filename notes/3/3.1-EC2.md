# EC2 Overview

Each EC2 has
- OS
- storage
- CPU
- RAM
- Network capabilities

### AMI
- Temlate that contains configuration for an instance
- AMI is configured for a particular region

### Instance Type
Virtual hardware configuration
- storage
- CPU
- RAM
- Network capabilities

### SSH
Use a key pair to connect via SSH to the instance

---

### Limits
By default can only run a certain amount of a resource on AWS

### Reserved Instances
Can reserve an instance for up to 75% discount
- reserve for 1 or 3 years

### Spot Request
- AWS has capacity that is not being used
- Get at very high discount
- Cavaet is that if someone is willing to pay higher price, you will loose the service

### Savings Plan
- Similar to a reserved instance

### Dedicated Host
- A dedicated physical server

### Scheduled Instances
- reserve on recurring scheudle
- purchase recurring Amazon EC2 compute capacity by the hour for a one-year term
- ie. from 4-7pm every day

### Capacity Reservations
- reserves capacity to guard against AWS running out of on demand capacity
- good for critical, time sensitive workload

### Elastic Block Store
- storage used with EC2 instances

### security groups

### Elastic IPs

---

### Launch EC2 Instance

EC2 instances are automatically assigned an IP address based on the subnet they are placed in

## Tags
Assign meta data to instance

Security group
SSH - linux
RDP - windows

---

## Exercise

### Part 1
- Create EC2 instance A and EC2 instance B
- Create security group A
  - Allow impc traffic from security group A
- Place both EC2 instances in security group A
- ssh into both EC2 instances
- ping from one EC2 instance to the other

### Part 2
- Create security group B
- Move EC2 instance B into security group B
- Update security group A to accept impc traffic from security group B
- Update security group B to accept impc traffic from security group A
- ping from one EC2 instance to the other

## Instance Meta Data
Data about an instance that can be used to configure or manage an instance

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)

## Accessing EC2 Meta Data While SSH'ed in EC2 Instance

Access EC2 meta data
`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/<category>`

---

EC2 Metadata CLI

download CLI
`wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2metadata/ec2-metadata`

Add Executable permissions
`chmod u+x ec2-metadata`

Can now ec2-metadata to retrieve meta data about ec2 instance
`ec2-metadata -help`

---

## User Data

### Disecting Boot script
```sh
#!/bin/bash # path to interpreter
yum update -y # update packages
yum install httpd -y # install deamon
systemctl start httpd # start and enable http server
systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html # create html file
echo "This is a test page running on Apache on EC2 in the AWS Cloud" > index.html
```
---

### Exercise

Create EC2 instance
- Add user data
- in security group make sure instance has http access

---

## EC2 Status Checks and Montiring

system status checks
- AWS needs to repair

instance status checks
- You need to repair
- having to do with the OS

CloudWatch

Basic Monitoring
- Every 5 minutes

detailed monitoring (every 1 minute)
  - must pay for

### Alarm
- Can take an action when CPU reaches certain threshhold
  - ie. terminate the instance

### Exercise

Create EC2 Instance
- give ssh access
- Create an alarm to terminate the instance when CPU reaches 80%

- SSH into instance

[Trigger high CPU load]
- Install repo for stress tool
`sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y`

- Install stress tool
`sudo yum install stress -y`

- Spans workers on CPU
`stress -c 8`

- Watch in monitoring tab
- After few minutes will register stress on CPU
- then terminate instance
