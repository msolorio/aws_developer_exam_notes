# Public, Private, and Elastic IP Addresses Overview

### Public IP Address
- lost when the instance is stopped
- if the instance is started up again you get a new public IP address
- no charge
- associated with a private IP on the instance
- cannot be moved accross instances

### Private IP Address
- retained when the instance is stopped
- what the OS sees

### Elastic IP Address
- Static public IP address
- retained when the instance is stopped
- charged if not used
- no charge if we do use them
- Can be moved between instances

## Network Address Translation - NAT

- When request enters VPC it is routed to Internet Gateway
- Internet Gateway performs NAT - Network Address Translation
  - Swaps public IP address (recipient address) with the corresponding private IP address
  - sends request to appropriate instance

- When instance sends a response it is route to Internet Gateway
- Internet Gateway performs NAT - Network Address Translation
  - Swaps instance's private IP address with the corresponding public IP address (return address)

## Exercise

- Create an EC2 instance with SSH included in it's security group
- Notice the private IP address sits within the CIDR block of the containing subnet
- SSH into Instance
  - run `iconfig`
  - see the private IP address listed under inet
  - notice no public IP address listed. Instance's OS does not know about the public IP

- In EC2 console
  - Take note of the public and private IP addresses
- Stop the instance
  - Notice the public IP goes away
- Start the instance
  - Notice there is a new public IP
